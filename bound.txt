The total mass should not increase by more than about 25%.

This guess comes as follows: 6 in constant r can be reduced 
to about 1.5, and sampling 4 points (2 of each as we will do) 
corresponds to delta of sqrt(2), so growth must be bounded 
by total mass divided by 3sqrt(2), which means 23.57%.

(What if we sample more?)
